stm32f4-thrift
==============

An example that uses thrift-nano to read/write messages over usb on an STM32F4.  

Based on USB CDC code I found here: http://vedder.se/2012/07/usb-serial-on-stm32f4/

Building
========

This project uses the [stm32-cmake toolchain](https://github.com/ObKo/stm32-cmake.git) to build.  Clone that repo and setup your environment to build the example projects provided.  This project may be built in a fashion similar to the stm32-cmake toolchain examples.
